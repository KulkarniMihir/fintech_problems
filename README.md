# Insurance Premium Prediction 
1. Objective: Predicted insurance premiums using supervised learning techniques by analyzing various demographic and health-related features.

2. Data Analysis: Explored and preprocessed a real-world insurance dataset containing features like age, BMI, gender, smoking status, and region.

3. Feature Engineering: Derived new features from existing variables, handled missing data, and applied label encoding and normalization to improve model performance.

4. Modeling: Built and evaluated regression models including Random Forest Regressor and XGBoost, optimizing hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.

5. Evaluation: Assessed models using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² scores, with special focus on RMSLE due to its suitability for asymmetric error tolerance.

6. Tools & Libraries: Python, pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, XGBoost, matplotlib.

7. Outcome: Achieved high predictive accuracy on test data; demonstrated ability to translate business objectives into practical machine learning solutions.
